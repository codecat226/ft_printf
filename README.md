# FT_PRINTF 

A simplified version of the printf function in C. Part of the 42 curriculum projects.
The project helped me to learn variadic functions.

### Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Compile
   ```sh
   make
   ```
3. Include in your own .c file
   ```sh
   #include "ft_printf.h"
   ```
4. Use as you would with printf()
   ```sh
   
   ft_printf("%s\n", "hello world");
   ```
